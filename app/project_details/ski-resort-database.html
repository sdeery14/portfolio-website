<p>The Ski Resort Management System is designed to manage various operations at a ski resort, including tracking lift tickets, equipment rentals, and skier information. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a functional database system, showcasing the integration of data analysis, modeling, and SQL scripting.</p>
            <p><strong>Data:</strong> The dataset used includes various records related to ski resort operations, such as customer information, ticket sales, rental details, and ski lift usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Data cleaning involved removing duplicate records, correcting inconsistent data entries, and ensuring referential integrity in the database.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> EDA was conducted to understand the patterns and trends in the data. Key insights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Peak usage times for ski lifts and equipment rentals.</li>
                <li>Customer demographics and their preferences for different services.</li>
                <li>Revenue patterns based on ticket sales and rentals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Modeling:</strong> SQL queries and scripts were developed to facilitate various operations, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generating reports on daily and monthly revenue.</li>
                <li>Tracking inventory levels of rental equipment.</li>
                <li>Analyzing customer feedback to improve services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Ski Resort Database System effectively manages the operations and provides valuable insights to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency.</p>
